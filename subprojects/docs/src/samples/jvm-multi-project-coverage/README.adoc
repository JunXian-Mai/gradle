This sample shows how to generate code coverage reports within a JVM multi-project build in Gradle.
This is the same pattern used by all JVM languages (Java, Groovy, Scala).

Each subproject uses the `application` or `java-library` plugin.

====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="application/build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="application/build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

The root build provides the `codeCoverageTask` that collects the coverage information from the subprojects.
To ensure the coverage data is present, the `codeCoverageTask` depends on all `test` tasks (but does not have to).

====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

To generate the code coverage report, you simply need to invoke the task:

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ ./gradlew :codeCoverageReport

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
10 actionable tasks: 10 executed
